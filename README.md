This project was inspired by the Stanford MOOC CS183, (Startup Engineering)[http://online.stanford.edu/course/startup-engineering]

Startup Engineering was a fantastic class that provided many people interested creating a Startup a basic technology stack to build up their business.

This repo aims to update some core components of that stack -- specifically to make it:
 * easier to deploy
 * focused on container based applications

As a Red Hat employee, I have chosen to create this initially with Red Hat products -- but I've tried my best to allow for components to be replaced interchangeably as desired.
